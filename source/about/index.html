        Simply referred to as <b>Chavez</b>. I came up through <b>Ruby on Rails</b>
        and <b>iOS</b> consulting into the tech and startup world in Chandler, AZ with
        <a href="http://integrumtech.com">Integrum</a>. I'm well versed in <b>Agile</b>,
        Scrum and XP as these have been the tools I have used to learn about each project
        I have been a part of.
      </p>

      <p>
        I moved on from consulting to help build the foundations of <a href="http://authoritylabs.com" target="_blank">AuthorityLabs</a>.
        Growing in the ways of <b>big data</b> and scaling was what happened here daily. Approaching
        problems with this in mind helped me learn about myself as a programmer and engineer
        and came to love the term of <em>defensive coding</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Still wanting to learn more and cut my chops more on the engineering side I
        made the move out to <b>San Francisco</b>. I found a home with <a href="http://kiip.me" target="_blank">Kiip</a>,
        pronounced <em>keep</em>. I further expanded my toolset jumping into <b>Python</b>.
        Here I learned <b>Go</b>, a modern language from Google, and implemented several
        services to <b>optimize</b> the Python stack to help scale the Kiip API even further.
      </p>

      <p>
        I try to spend my free time exploring San Francisco, <b>playing music</b>, going out
        to see shows and continue learning. You can see some of my work on my
        <a href="http://github.com/mthcavez">github</a> account. There is where I have
        open sourced iOS applications as well as played around with machine learning
        and various algoritms in languages such as Go, Python, Ruby, Julia, Objective-C, Erlang and
        others.
